These properties shadow any\n     *   host properties, and changes within the template to these properties\n     *   will result in `notifyInstanceProp` being called.\n     * - `mutableData`: When `true`, the generated class will skip strict\n     *   dirty-checking for objects and arrays (always consider them to be\n     *   \"dirty\").\n     * - `notifyInstanceProp(instance, property, value)`: Called when\n     *   an instance property changes.  Users may choose to call `notifyPath`\n     *   on e.g. the owner to notify the change.\n     * - `parentModel`: When `true`, events handled by declarative event listeners\n     *   (`on-event=\"handler\"`) will be decorated with a `model` property pointing\n     *   to the template instance that stamped it.

It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety\n  of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n   See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n   ### Closing and canceling\n   An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user\n  intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,\n  it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is\n  configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.\n  `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control\n  in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'\n  event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.\n   ### Positioning\n   By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can\n  position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n   ### Backdrop\n   Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is\n  appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling\n  options.\n   In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.\n  Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)\n  to achieve a different behavior.\n   ### Limitations\n   The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You\n  must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking\n  context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.\n   @demo demo/index.html\n  @polymerBehavior\n  */\n  Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior = [Polymer.IronFitBehavior, Polymer.IronResizableBehavior, Polymer.IronOverlayBehaviorImpl];\n\n  /**\n   * Fired after the overlay opens.\n   * @event iron-overlay-opened\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the overlay is canceled, but before it is closed.\n   * @event iron-overlay-canceled\n   * @param {Event} event The closing of the overlay can be prevented\n   * by calling `event.preventDefault()`.

You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension\n[like x-meta] for enhancements).\n\nThe `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an import,\nor constructed in any way you see fit. The only requirement is that you create them\nbefore you try to access them.\n\nExamples:\n\nIf I create an instance like this:\n\n    <iron-meta key=\"info\" value=\"foo/bar\"></iron-meta>\n\nNote that value=\"foo/bar\" is the metadata I've defined. I could define more\nattributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.\n\nNow I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance\nvia the byKey method, e.g.\n\n    meta.byKey('info');\n\nPure imperative form would be like:\n\n    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info');\n\nOr, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:\n\n    <iron-meta id=\"meta\"></iron-meta>\n    ...\n    this.$.meta.byKey('info');\n\n@group Iron Elements\n@demo demo/index.html\n@hero hero.svg\n@element iron-meta\n-->\n\n<script>\n\n  (function() {\n\n    /**\n     * @constructor\n     * @param {{type: (string|null), key: (string|null), value: *}} options\n     */\n    function IronMeta(options) {\n      this.type = (options && options.type) || 'default';\n      this.key = options && options.key;\n      if ('value' in options) {\n        this.value = options.value;\n      }\n    }\n\n    IronMeta.types = {};\n\n    IronMeta.prototype = {\n      get value() {\n        var type = this.type;\n        var key = this.key;\n\n        if (type && key) {\n          return IronMeta.types[type] && IronMeta.types[type][key];\n        }\n      },\n\n      set value(value) {\n        var type = this.type;\n        var key = this.key;\n\n        if (type && key) {\n          type = IronMeta.types[type] = IronMeta.types[type] || {};\n          if (value == null) {\n            delete type[key];\n          } else {\n            type[key] = value;\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n      get list() {\n        var type = this.type;\n\n        if (type) {\n          return Object.keys(IronMeta.types[this.type]).map(function(key) {\n            return metaDatas[this.type][key];\n          }, this);\n        }\n      },\n\n      byKey: function(key) {\n        this.key = key;\n        return this.value;\n      }\n    };\n\n    Polymer.IronMeta = IronMeta;\n\n    var metaDatas = Polymer.IronMeta.types;\n\n    Polymer({\n\n      is: 'iron-meta',\n\n      properties: {\n\n        /**\n         * The type of meta-data.

It includes an optional backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety\n  of UI controls including dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.\n\n  See the [demo source code](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)\n  for an example.\n\n  ### Closing and canceling\n\n  An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close and cancel is user\n  intent. Closing generally implies that the user acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default,\n  it will cancel whenever the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is\n  configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties.\n  `close()` should be called explicitly by the implementer when the user interacts with a control\n  in the overlay element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an 'iron-overlay-canceled'\n  event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent the overlay from closing.\n\n  ### Positioning\n\n  By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the window. You can\n  position and size it manually using CSS. See `Polymer.IronFitBehavior`.\n\n  ### Backdrop\n\n  Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay. The backdrop is\n  appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`. See its doc page for styling\n  options.\n\n  In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the light DOM.\n  Override the [`_focusableNodes` getter](#Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior:property-_focusableNodes)\n  to achieve a different behavior.\n\n  ### Limitations\n\n  The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its `z-index` property. You\n  must ensure no element has a stacking context with a higher `z-index` than its parent stacking\n  context. You should place this element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.\n\n  @demo demo/index.html\n  @polymerBehavior\n  */\n  Polymer.IronOverlayBehavior = [Polymer.IronFitBehavior, Polymer.IronResizableBehavior, Polymer.IronOverlayBehaviorImpl];\n\n  /**\n   * Fired after the overlay opens.\n   * @event iron-overlay-opened\n   */\n\n  /**\n   * Fired when the overlay is canceled, but before it is closed.\n   * @event iron-overlay-canceled\n   * @param {Event} event The closing of the overlay can be prevented\n   * by calling `event.preventDefault()`.

To use it, you must distribute a native `<input>`\nyourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would normally:\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n    <iron-input>\n      <input type=\"email\" disabled>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Two-way binding\n\nBy default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`\ndue to user input:\n\n    <input value=\"{{myValue::input}}\">\n\nThis means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value = 'foo'`),\nno events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.\n\n`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s '`value` property; this\nproperty can be used for two-way data binding.\n`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.\n\n    <iron-input bind-value=\"{{myValue}}\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\nNote: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you _must_\nset `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be notified.\n\n### Validation\n\n`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`\nhas a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed `input`'s\nvalidity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for styling.\n\nTo validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate` attribute.\n\n`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is\ncalled. You can use it to implement a custom validator:\n\n    var CatsOnlyValidator = {\n      validate: function(ironInput) {\n        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';\n        ironInput.invalid = !valid;\n        return valid;\n      }\n    }\n    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {\n      CatsOnly.validate(input2);\n    });\n\nYou can also use an element implementing an [`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).\nThis example can also be found in the demo for this element:\n\n    <iron-input validator=\"cats-only\">\n      <input>\n    </iron-input>\n\n### Preventing invalid input\n\nIt may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use the\n`allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature\nis separate from validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is validated.\n\n    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.\n    <iron-input allowed-pattern=\"[0-9]\">\n      <input pattern=\"\\d{5}\">\n    </iron-input>\n\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n-->\n\n<dom-module id=\"iron-input\">\n  <template>\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <slot id=\"content\"></slot>\n  </template>\n  <script>\n    Polymer({\n      is: 'iron-input',\n\n      behaviors: [\n        Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior\n      ],\n\n      /**\n       * Fired whenever `validate()` is called.\n       *\n       * @event iron-input-validate\n       */\n\n      properties: {\n\n        /**\n         * Use this property instead of `value` for two-way data binding, or to\n         * set a default value for the input. **Do not** use the distributed\n         * input's `value` property to set a default value.\n         */\n        bindValue: {\n          type: String\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Computed property that echoes `bindValue` (mostly used for Polymer 1.0\n         * backcompatibility, if you were one-way binding to the Polymer 1.0\n         * `input is=\"iron-input\"` value attribute).\n         */\n        value: {\n          computed: '_computeValue(bindValue)'\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Regex-like list of characters allowed as input; all characters not in the list\n         * will be rejected.

You can configure\nthe attribute it listens to with the `attr-for-value` attribute.\n\n### Using a custom input element\n\nYou can use a custom input element in a `<paper-input-container>`, for example to implement a\ncompound input field like a social security number input. The custom input element should have the\n`paper-input-input` class, have a `notify:true` value property and optionally implements\n`Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior` if it is validatable.\n\n    <paper-input-container attr-for-value=\"ssn-value\">\n      <label slot=\"label\">Social security number</label>\n      <ssn-input slot=\"input\" class=\"paper-input-input\"></ssn-input>\n    </paper-input-container>\n\n\nIf you're using a `<paper-input-container>` imperatively, it's important to make sure\nthat you attach its children (the `iron-input` and the optional `label`) before you\nattach the `<paper-input-container>` itself, so that it can be set up correctly.\n\n### Validation\n\nIf the `auto-validate` attribute is set, the input container will validate the input and update\nthe container styling when the input value changes.\n\n### Add-ons\n\nAdd-ons are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `add-on` attribute and\nimplements the `Polymer.PaperInputAddonBehavior` behavior. They are notified when the input value\nor validity changes, and may implement functionality such as error messages or character counters.\nThey appear at the bottom of the input.\n\n### Prefixes and suffixes\nThese are child elements of a `<paper-input-container>` with the `prefix`\nor `suffix` attribute, and are displayed inline with the input, before or after.\n\n    <paper-input-container>\n      <div slot=\"prefix\">$</div>\n      <label slot=\"label\">Total</label>\n      <iron-input slot=\"input\">\n        <input>\n      </iron-input>\n      // In Polymer 1.0, you would use `<input

The currently selected\nitem is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is\ndisplayed instead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-dropdown-menu label=\"Your favourite pastry\">\n      <paper-listbox slot=\"dropdown-content\">\n        <paper-item>Croissant</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Donut</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Financier</paper-item>\n        <paper-item>Madeleine</paper-item>\n      </paper-listbox>\n    </paper-dropdown-menu>\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nThe child element with the slot `dropdown-content` is used as the dropdown\nmenu. This can be a [`paper-listbox`](paper-listbox), or any other or\nelement that acts like an [`iron-selector`](iron-selector).\n\nSpecifically, the menu child must fire an\n[`iron-select`](iron-selector#event-iron-select) event when one of its\nchildren is selected, and an [`iron-deselect`](iron-selector#event-iron-deselect)\nevent when a child is deselected. The selected or deselected item must\nbe passed as the event's `detail.item` property.\n\nApplications can listen for the `iron-select` and `iron-deselect` events\nto react when options are selected and deselected.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n\nYou can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`\nstyle mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button\nrespectively.\n\n@group Paper Elements\n@element paper-dropdown-menu\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n-->\n\n<dom-module id=\"paper-dropdown-menu\">\n  <template>\n    <style include=\"paper-dropdown-menu-shared-styles\"></style>\n\n    <!-- this div fulfills an a11y requirement for combobox, do not remove -->\n    <span role=\"button\"></span>\n    <paper-menu-button\n      id=\"menuButton\"\n      vertical-align=\"[[verticalAlign]]\"\n      horizontal-align=\"[[horizontalAlign]]\"\n      dynamic-align=\"[[dynamicAlign]]\"\n      vertical-offset=\"[[_computeMenuVerticalOffset(noLabelFloat)]]\"\n      disabled=\"[[disabled]]\"\n      no-animations=\"[[noAnimations]]\"\n      on-iron-select=\"_onIronSelect\"\n      on-iron-deselect=\"_onIronDeselect\"\n      opened=\"{{opened}}\"\n      close-on-activate\n      allow-outside-scroll=\"[[allowOutsideScroll]]\"\n      restore-focus-on-close=\"[[restoreFocusOnClose]]\">\n      <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-menu-button 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n      <div class=\"dropdown-trigger\" slot=\"dropdown-trigger\">\n        <paper-ripple></paper-ripple>\n        <!-- paper-input has type=\"text\" for a11y, do not remove -->\n        <paper-input\n          type=\"text\"\n          invalid=\"[[invalid]]\"\n          readonly\n          disabled=\"[[disabled]]\"\n          value=\"[[selectedItemLabel]]\"\n          placeholder=\"[[placeholder]]\"\n          error-message=\"[[errorMessage]]\"\n          always-float-label=\"[[alwaysFloatLabel]]\"\n          no-label-float=\"[[noLabelFloat]]\"\n          label=\"[[label]]\">\n          <!-- support hybrid mode: user might be using paper-input 1.x which distributes via <content> -->\n          <iron-icon icon=\"paper-dropdown-menu:arrow-drop-down\" suffix slot=\"suffix\"></iron-icon>\n        </paper-input>\n      </div>\n      <slot id=\"content\" name=\"dropdown-content\" slot=\"dropdown-content\"></slot>\n    </paper-menu-button>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    (function() {\n      'use strict';\n\n      Polymer({\n        is: 'paper-dropdown-menu',\n\n        behaviors: [\n          Polymer.IronButtonState,\n          Polymer.IronControlState,\n          Polymer.IronFormElementBehavior,\n          Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior\n        ],\n\n        properties: {\n          /**\n           * The derived \"label\" of the currently selected item.

User\ncan tap the checkbox to check or uncheck it.  Usually you use checkboxes\nto allow user to select multiple options from a set.  If you have a single\nON/OFF option, avoid using a single checkbox and use `paper-toggle-button`\ninstead.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-checkbox>label</paper-checkbox>\n\n    <paper-checkbox checked> label</paper-checkbox>\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-checkbox-unchecked-background-color` | Checkbox background color when the input is not checked | `transparent`\n`--paper-checkbox-unchecked-color` | Checkbox border color when the input is not checked | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-unchecked-ink-color` | Selected/focus ripple color when the input is not checked | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-checked-color` | Checkbox color when the input is checked | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-checked-ink-color` | Selected/focus ripple color when the input is checked | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-checkmark-color` | Checkmark color | `white`\n`--paper-checkbox-label-color` | Label color | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-label-checked-color` | Label color when the input is checked | `--paper-checkbox-label-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-label-spacing` | Spacing between the label and the checkbox | `8px`\n`--paper-checkbox-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-checkbox-label-checked` | Mixin applied to the label when the input is checked | `{}`\n`--paper-checkbox-error-color` | Checkbox color when invalid | `--error-color`\n`--paper-checkbox-size` | Size of the checkbox | `18px`\n`--paper-checkbox-ink-size` | Size of the ripple | `48px`\n`--paper-checkbox-margin` | Margin around the checkbox container | `initial`\n`--paper-checkbox-vertical-align` | Vertical alignment of the checkbox container | `middle`\n\nThis element applies the mixin `--paper-font-common-base` but does not import `paper-styles/typography.html`.\nIn order to apply the `Roboto` font to this element, make sure you've imported `paper-styles/typography.html`.\n\n@demo demo/index.html\n-->\n\n<dom-module id=\"paper-checkbox\">\n  <template strip-whitespace>\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: inline-block;\n

Note that this\nis a breaking change from iron-form 1.0, which was a type extension.\n\nIt has two modes: if `allow-redirect` is true, then after the form submission you\nwill be redirected to the server response. Otherwise, if it is false, it will\nuse an `iron-ajax` element to submit the form contents to the server.\n\n  Example:\n\n    <iron-form>\n      <form method=\"get\" action=\"/form/handler\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"Batman\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"donuts\" checked> I like donuts<br>\n        <paper-checkbox name=\"cheese\" value=\"yes\" checked></paper-checkbox>\n      </form>\n    </iron-form>\n\nBy default, a native `<button>` element will submit this form. However, if you\nwant to submit it from a custom element's click handler, you need to explicitly\ncall the `iron-form`'s `submit` method.\n\n  Example:\n\n    <paper-button raised onclick=\"submitForm()\">Submit</paper-button>\n\n    function submitForm() {\n      document.getElementById('iron-form').submit();\n    }\n\nIf you are not using the `allow-redirect` mode, then you also have the option of\ncustomizing the request sent to the server. To do so, you can listen to the `iron-form-presubmit`\nevent, and modify the form's [`iron-ajax`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-ajax)\nobject. However, If you want to not use `iron-ajax` at all, you can cancel the\nevent and do your own custom submission:\n\n  Example of modifying the request, but still using the build-in form submission:\n\n    form.addEventListener('iron-form-presubmit', function() {\n      this.request.method = 'put';\n      this.request.params['extraParam'] = 'someValue';\n    });\n\n  Example of bypassing the build-in form submission:\n\n    form.addEventListener('iron-form-presubmit', function(event) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n      var firebase = new Firebase(form.getAttribute('action'));\n      firebase.set(form.serializeForm());\n    });\n\nNote that if you're dynamically creating this element, it's mandatory that you\nfirst create the contained `<form>` element and all its children, and only then\nattach it to the `<iron-form>`:\n\n  var wrapper = document.createElement('iron-form');\n  var form = document.createElement('form');\n  var input = document.createElement('input');\n  form.appendChild(input);\n  document.body.appendChild(wrapper);\n  wrapper.appendChild(form);\n\n@element iron-form\n@hero hero.svg\n@demo demo/index.html\n-->\n\n<dom-module id=\"iron-form\">\n  <template>\n    <style>\n      :host {\n        display: block;\n      }\n    </style>\n\n    <!-- This form is used to collect the elements that should be submitted -->\n    <slot></slot>\n\n    <!-- This form is used for submission -->\n    <form id=\"helper\" action$=\"[[action]]\" method$=\"[[method]]\" enctype$=\"[[enctype]]\"></form>\n  </template>\n\n  <script>\n    Polymer({\n      is: 'iron-form',\n\n      properties: {\n        /*\n         * Set this to true if you don't want the form to be submitted through an\n         * ajax request, and you want the page to redirect to the action URL\n         * after the form has been submitted.\n         */\n        allowRedirect: {\n          type: Boolean,\n          value: false\n        },\n        /**\n        * HTTP request headers to send.
