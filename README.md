## Where are the files?

It is inside `src` folder. Styles are inside the `styles` folder with each part separated in the `components` folder.

When you run the server, the files are sourced out and compiled to the `public` folder. Whenever you edit files,

You can also directly edit files in the `public` folder. But remember that it will be overwritten once you have
edited some files in the `src` folder
